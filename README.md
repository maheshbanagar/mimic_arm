# Image Processing Based Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm
Robotic Arms are used everywhere in our modern society. They are used in manufacturing industry, biomedical industry, scientific research and various other fields.
Robots that can mimic human movement can be extremely useful and can be used in environments where not suitable for humans.
This project focuses on mimicking human movement with the help of image processing.We use Open CV which is a real time computer vision library to detect arm movement and skeletal joint positions as well as Media Pipe a Machine Learning tool used for Human Pose estimation.
We use this information to implement the robotic movement with the help of an microcontroller and servo motors.
